# Reporting Vulnerabilities

Thank you for your cooperation!

We have several ways to report vulnerabilities:

- **(Recommended) GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** Learn more at [Privately reporting a security vulnerability - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
